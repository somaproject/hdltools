Overview of our modelsim design and test framework for unit testing of vhdl projects. 


For each compontent in the system, we create a 
"simulations" directory

Under there, each simulation simname is a simulation of a specific component. 

There can be more than one simname for a component, although ideally each component would instead have a suite of tests. 

inside, each has a simname.do file that is a do file for modelsim which contains all the necessary commands. 


All tests continually check data, and when they fail raise an assert error of severity failure, which we detect and record. 

Once we've received an error, we kill the program. 




Things to do: 
  * if compile fails, modelsim halts
